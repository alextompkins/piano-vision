### Production ###
To do a production install, run `pip install .` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Development ###
To install the package for development, run `pip install -e .[dev]`. This installs all the regular required packages and those listed in the dev section of extras_require.

After adding any dependencies to `setup.py`, regenerate the `requirements.txt` file with `pip-compile`.
